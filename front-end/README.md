## 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-transaction-tool.git
cd hedera-transaction-tool/front-end
```

## 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

## 3. Generate Prisma client library

```bash
pnpm generate:database
```

## 4. Start developing

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## 5. Build for distribution

```bash
pnpm build:mac # uses mac as build target
```

## 6. Run the unit tests

```bash
pnpm test:main # run tests for the main process
```

Run the tests with coverage

```bash
pnpm test:main:coverage # run tests for the main process
```

## 7. Troubleshooting

- **Prisma issues**
  - If you encounter problems with `@prisma/client`:
    
    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    ```
  - Alternatively, reinstall `node_modules` and run:
    
    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    ```

- **ENOENT errors**
  - If errors persist after reinstalling `node_modules` and running `prisma_generate`, it may be caused by a missing Electron distribution.  
  - To fix this, manually rebuild Electron from the `front-end` directory:
    
    ```bash
    pnpm rebuild electron
    ```
