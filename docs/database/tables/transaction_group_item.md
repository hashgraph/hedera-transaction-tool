# transaction_group_item

**Description**: A transaction group is a collection of transactions that need to be executed simultaneously. This allows for a coordinated and synchronized execution of multiple related transactions. The `transaction_group_item` table stores information about the individual transaction in the transaction group and its relative sequence to other transactions in the group.
